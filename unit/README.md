# Unit testing

Workflow to to run the unit tests:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:mrnorman/ponni.git
cd ponni
# Run command below to use the kokkos submodule of this repo
git submodule update --init --checkout -- unit/build/externals/kokkos
cd unit/build
# To change the kokkos used for testing, change KOKKOS_HOME in the machine file
source machines/[machine_name]/[machine_file]
./cmakescript.sh
make -j8
ctest -V
```

## gcov coverage workflow

To build unit tests with gcov instrumentation and generate coverage reports:

```bash
cd unit/build
# Use a machine file, then enable coverage before configuring.
source machines/[machine_name]/[machine_file]
export PONNI_COVERAGE=ON
./cmakescript.sh
make -j8
# Run all tests with verbose output.
ctest -V
# Generate coverage report target (requires gcov; gcovr is optional).
make coverage
```

Coverage output:
- `unit/build/coverage/gcov.txt` (always generated when `gcov` is available)
- `unit/build/coverage/coverage.txt` (generated when `gcovr` is available)
- `unit/build/coverage/index.html` (generated when `gcovr` is available)
